A note on installing Docker

In the upcoming Demo we will see how to install Docker on a Linux machine.

However, remember that you don't really need to setup your own Docker system to complete this course. We have hands-on labs that open up right in your browser.



If you really wish to setup your own system, then feel free to follow along. In case you are on Windows, you have 2 options:



1. Install Virtualbox and deploy a Linux VM and then follow the upcoming demo to install Docker on that Linux VM.

2. Install Docker on Windows. Watch this lecture and demo on Docker on Windows now - "Docker on Windows" and "Demo - Docker on Windows" in Section 8.
